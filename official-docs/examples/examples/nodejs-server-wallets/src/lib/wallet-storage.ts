/**
 * Wallet Storage Utilities
 *
 * ⚠️ WARNING: FOR TESTING AND DEVELOPMENT ONLY - NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE
 *
 * This file provides simple file-based storage for wallet key shares.
 * It is intended ONLY for local development and testing purposes.
 *
 * DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION because:
 * - Key shares are stored unencrypted in a local JSON file
 * - No access control or security measures are implemented
 * - File permissions are not managed
 * - No backup or recovery mechanisms
 *
 * For production environments, you should:
 * - Use a secure key management service (AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)
 * - Encrypt key shares at rest
 * - Implement proper access controls and audit logging
 * - Use a secure database with encryption
 * - Follow your organization's security best practices
